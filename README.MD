# Guess-it-2

## Description

**Guess-it-2** is a Go program that reads a series of floating-point numbers from user input and uses linear regression to predict the next value based on the input data. The program calculates the coefficients for the linear regression model and provides a range around the predicted value, allowing users to see potential future values.

## Features

- Accepts a series of floating-point numbers as input.
- Computes linear regression coefficients (slope and intercept).
- Predicts the next value based on the input data.
- Provides a range around the predicted value with adjustable margins.

## Prerequisites

- Go programming language installed (version 1.15 or later).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
